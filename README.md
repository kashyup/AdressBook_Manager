## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://hans-contact-keeper.herokuapp.com/)

This application was created using the MERN stack. React serves as the front end, Express serves as the backend, Node serves as the environment, MongoDB serves as the database, and mongoose serves as the ORM. I'm using the context API for the State manager.
